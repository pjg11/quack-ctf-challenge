# QUACK
A `pyjail` challenge I created and hosted during my time at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=2ac66128b9116e0722d941ebf7e14b5a).

A sleepy duck is blocking the way to my files.
can you wake it up (gently) and ask it for
flag.txt? Thanks!
```

## Usage

Build and run the challenge container with:
```sh
$ ./build.sh
```

Access the challenge via `ssh`:
```sh
# Password: pass
$ ssh -p 9999 user@localhost
```

## How did I make this?
I go over the details of the challenge and resources in a [blog post](https://pjg1.site/rc05).
